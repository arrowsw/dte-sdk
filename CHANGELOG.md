# Changelog

All notable changes to **dte-sdk** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Core issuance: `createDocument`, `stampDocument` (TED), `signDocument` (enveloped XMLDSig),
  `issueDocument`, `createEnvelope`/`signEnvelope` (`EnvioDTE`, `EnvioBOLETA`), verification
  helpers (`verifyTed`, `verifyDocumentSignature`, `verifyEnvelopeSignature`).
- Domain model in English with bilingual (EN/ES) JSDoc, SII-shaped types and the
  `toSiiDocument`/`fromSiiDocument` codec.
- Certificates from PKCS#12 and PEM, CAF parsing and validity, Chile-local timestamps,
  text sanitization and ISO-8859-1 encoding, SII status code classification.
- Dependencies: `node-forge`, `@xmldom/xmldom`, `fast-xml-parser`, `rut.ts`.
- SII web services client: `createSiiClient` (plain data, no methods) and free functions
  for seed/token on the DTEWS SOAP and receipts REST channels (`getSeed`, `getToken`),
  uploads (`uploadEnvelope`, `uploadBook`, `uploadFolioConsumption`) with duplicate
  recovery, status queries (`queryUploadStatus`, `waitForUploadStatus`,
  `queryDocumentStatus`, `folioReceived`) and the acceptance/claim registry
  (`registerClaim`, `listClaimEvents`, `queryTransferable`, `queryReceptionDate`,
  `receiverStatus`). Uploads and `registerClaim` are never re-sent once the SII has
  answered, even if the reply was cut off halfway (transport errors then carry
  `details.responseStarted: true`), except once with a fresh token when the SII refused
  the token. `retry.retryOn` can narrow what is retried, never widen it. Getting a token is
  one retry loop around seed, signature and token (a fresh seed per attempt), and
  `waitForUploadStatus` polls inside a hard `timeoutMs` budget instead of applying the
  retry policy to every poll. Uploaded XML must open with an XML declaration naming
  ISO-8859-1 (the bytes sent are ISO-8859-1), else `INVALID_OPTION { field: 'xml' }`
  before anything is sent; whitespace before the declaration is dropped. Errors follow the
  spec: transport failures carry `details.operation` (and `timeoutMs` on `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`),
  `SII_HTTP_ERROR` carries `details.url` (never in the message) and
  `SII_UPLOAD_REJECTED.details.status` is a number.
- Injectable HTTP transport (`createFetchTransport`, `createNodeHttpsTransport` with TLS
  verification on by default; `tls.ca` adds to Node's bundled roots instead of replacing
  them), token cache, retry policy with backoff, HTTP capture with
  redaction (`createMemoryCapture`, `createDirectoryCapture`) and upload archive
  (`createMemoryUploadArchive`, `createDirectoryUploadArchive`; a duplicate answer is kept
  as `<trackId>-<kind>-duplicate-<timestamp>` and archived replies and SOAP fault reasons have
  tokens redacted). SOAP calls send `SOAPAction: ""`. The Node adapters load
  `node:` modules lazily, so importing the package evaluates no `node:` module.
- Catalogs: `DTEUpload` reception statuses, claim actions/events/response codes,
  `FAN` document status, the `RCO` envelope status (rejected), REST per-document status
  endpoint, WSRECLAMO service URLs (`CLAIM_WS_ENDPOINTS`) and their WSDLs
  (`CLAIM_WSDL_ENDPOINTS`).
- Helpers for custom adapters and tests: `buildMultipartBody` (with `generateBoundary`,
  `multipartContentType`), `buildSoapEnvelope`/`parseSoapResponse` (with `SOAP_HEADERS`,
  `stripNamespacePrefixes`), `parseReceptionResponse`, `signSeed`, `signRootElement`,
  `redactExchange` (with `redactText`, `redactHeaders`), `withRetry` (with `mergeRetryPolicy`,
  `retryDelayMs`), `decodeBody`/`encodeUtf8`, `tokenCacheKey`/`certificateFingerprint`,
  `uploadRecordName`.

### Removed

- The placeholder `hello()` export.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-10-26

### Changed

- No public API or runtime changes. First release published from CI through
  npm Trusted Publishing (GitHub OIDC) with a provenance attestation;
  `0.0.1` was published manually to create the package on npm.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Initial placeholder release: project scaffolding (dual ESM + CJS build,
  Jest, ESLint, Prettier, size-limit, Stryker, CI and tag-triggered publish)
  and a single `hello()` export that returns `'dte-sdk is coming'`.
